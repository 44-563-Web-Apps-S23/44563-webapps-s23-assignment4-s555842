        <p> loved Tobby so! He always drove him to the Kortschagins
        or the Vlassovs. What a wonderful horse-man he was! How fine he looked
        when he pulled at the reins with all his might! Tobby, Tobby--give him
        an extra measure of oats to-day!</p>

        stops beating. <direction>[_She smiles through her tears._]</direction> And aren't you ashamed?
        I have been a good, true wife; I have imprisoned myself and I shall
        remain true until death, and you--you--you're not ashamed of yourself,
        my dear monster! You quarrelled with me, left me alone for weeks----</speech>
